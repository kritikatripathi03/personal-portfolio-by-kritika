            <h1>about.</h1>
            <p>I am a third-year BTech student with a great interest in programming, development, machine learning, and Web3! I know Python, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. I am learning and developing projects for the front end and am willing to discover more skills. I am also interested in research work and have written a paper named "Enhancing the Security of Online Voting System using Defined Biometrics" that has been accepted in the IEEE 3rd International Conference on TESMET 2023 and is yet to be published. Additionally, I am also working on another research paper that discovers Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning. With decent communication, leadership, and teamwork skills, I am inclined to pursue as many opportunities as possible! I learn from the people near me and endeavor to enhance my skills with every chance that comes my way.</p>
